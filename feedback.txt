Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
1: Created a method in USState.java which can create a USState enum based on abbreviation (USState key) rather than by full state name (USState value).
2: Created a Singleton class Languages to map a language’s local name (as seen on the webpages) to it’s English name (as desired to pass the tests). Only one map is required, so a Singleton was chosen to implement the mapper.
